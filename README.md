##Stress Test

Testing is awesome! Testing allows us to have confidence that the code we write does what
we expect it to and will continue to do so even as we add more code and
functionality to our apps. You can make changes without fear of breaking
something!

Here's the deal. I have an idea for an app but I'm stressed because I
don't trust Apple's built-in code. I have to use stuff like `NSString`,
`NSArray`, and `NSInteger` but I won't feel comfortable until we can write some
tests to prove that these things behave how we expect them to.

So let's go through the anatomy of a test. We're going to be using the Specta
testing framework so that's why the syntax won't look exactly like objective-c.

```objc
  describe(@"inside this DESCRIBE block I'll describe a method, so I'll just put the method name in this string", ^{
      it(@"this IT block contains a test. the description in this string should say clearly and explicitly what I expect to happen",^{
         NSString *pet = @"grumpy cat";
         expect(pet).to.equal(@"grumpy cat"); 
      });
      
      it(@"this IT block contains another test. so i should probably describe that test here",^{
         expect(2 == 2).to.beTruthy();
      });
  });
```

###**Super Important**
I know we're not used to this with objective-c but do you see the empty
parentheses after the beTruthy() method call above? The compiler will not complain if you forget these, but your tests will break. Equal and beTruthy are examples of matchers- and in Specta all matchers are followed by parentheses, full or empty, end of story. So don't forget them.

###Reading
all the matchers we will use and more info on testing syntax can be found [here](https://github.com/specta/expecta) in the docs

##Instructions
1. Open up your StressTest.xcworkspace file
2. Take a look at your `FISGenericTestSpecSpec.m` in the StressTestTests group
   in Xcode.
3. You should notice several things in our Spec file:
  - Our outermost `describe` block gives you the name of our Spec, in this case
    `FISGenericTestSpec`. This is typically the name of the file you are
    testing. As we are testing Apple's code, we're just going to call these
    tests generic.
  - Inside our outermost describe block, we have another describe block. This
    tell you what you can expect out of the tests below. Here we have our basic
    instructions to write our generic tests based on how they're being
    described.
    - each describe block in here will cover one type of 'matcher', like equal
      or notEqual. You can read more about the matchers we'll be using in the
      Reading section above.
    - each describe block may have several `it` blocks that explain what the
      code inside should be proving. All of the `it` blocks tell you to write
      your code inside of them.
